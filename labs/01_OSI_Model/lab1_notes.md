# Lab Notes

### Lab Overview
This lab was used to document and describe each of the seven layers of the OSI model by creating a diagram and then writing down clear, concise notes that gave clarity and demonstrated understanding on each layer 

### What I learned
Throughout this lab I learned the flow of data and how each layer of the OSI model ties together to keep networks and systems flowing smoothly. I became familiar with new tools and troubleshooting methods. For example, I learned how Wireshark is useed to view the traffic of packets so that you can see if they are getting to their destination correctly and smoothly, or if there are issues with packet transportation. I have gained a better understanding of the difference between MAC address and IP's. DHCP applies a unique IP address to each device so that they can be located. MAC addresses are used to determine which device to send it to and they are hardware coded. Things like ARP typically fail at the second layer, and DNS typically fails at the 7th layer

### Issues/struggles
At the start of the lab I struggled to get used to GitHub. Things such as uploading files or creating clear commit messages in small steps took some getting used to. I would sometimes get things about the 3rd and 4th layers mixed up. I thought that ping was more tied to the 4th where transportation happened rather than the 3rd where communications between multiple networks occurred. I did have a little bit of trouble with remembering the formatting of HTML at first as well. 

### Note structure
My notes were organized into bullet points to display clear and concise info that was significant to each layer
