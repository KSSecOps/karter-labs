# Karter's Rooted Labs,

**What this is:**  
This is my real-world lab to learn how systems work — not just configs, but the why behind them. **How it works:**  

-   **/labs/** — Hands-on practice. Each lab has my notes, tests, and what broke.
-   **/scripts/** — Small scripts I use to automate or test.
-   **/docs/** — Reference notes, RFCs, checklists.
-   **/diagrams/** — Visio or Draw.io maps showing how things connect.
-   **/governance/** — Change docs, CAB templates, fallback plans.

**Goal:**  
Prove what I learn, speak about it clearly, align it to real-world goals. 
</br>
</br>
**Proof:**  
Every lab gets a Discord post. Every config is versioned here. No “trust me bro.”
